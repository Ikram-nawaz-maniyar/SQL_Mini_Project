# 🍕 SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project

**By Ikram Nawaz Maniyar | January 2025**

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL** for performing data analysis on a pizza sales dataset. Using **SQL Workbench**, I explored key business insights by writing queries that analyze orders, revenue, customer behavior, and pizza preferences.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL Workbench
- Pizza Sales Dataset

## 🔍 Objectives

The project aims to answer several analytical questions such as:
- Total orders placed
- Total revenue generated
- Most ordered pizza size
- Top-selling pizza types
- Category-wise and time-wise sales breakdown
- Revenue trends and cumulative revenue analysis

## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Applied
- **Joins**
- **Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)**
- **Grouping and Filtering**
- **Subqueries**
- **Window Functions**

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Top 5 most ordered pizzas with quantities
- Distribution of orders by hour of the day
- Category-wise pizza sales
- Cumulative revenue trend
- Revenue contribution of each pizza type

## 🧾 Conclusion

This mini project solidified my skills in **database design**, **data querying**, and **SQL-based analytical thinking**. It reflects how structured querying can derive meaningful insights from raw data, supporting data-driven decision-making in business.
